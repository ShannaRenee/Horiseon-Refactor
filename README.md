## Description

For this project, my motivation was to refactor Horiseon's source code using sematic HTML elements and descriptive alt attributes to optimize search engine results and to comply with accessibility standards. By refactoring the codebase to be more acessible, Horiseon's website will be able to reach a wider userbase including those that use screen-reading devices. Through the use of semantic HTML elements and alt attributes, search engines will have an easier time directing users to Horiseon's website. Through the process of refactoring the source code, I learned how to use sematic HTML elements to make the code more readable for both users and developers. I also learned how to consolidate a CSS file to be less redundant and read more clearly.
